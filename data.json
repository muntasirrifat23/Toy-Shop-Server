        "des":"Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic-performance,[2][3] without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity or that emphasise the thrill of driving or are marketed using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track However other people have more specific definitions such as must be a two-seater or a 2 and 2 seater or a car with two seats only. In the United Kingdom early recorded usage of the sports car was in The Times newspaper in 1919. The first known use of the term in the United States was in 1928. Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s. The term was originally used for two-seat roadsters cars without a fixed roof however since the 1970s the term has also been used for cars with a fixed roof which were previously considered grand tourers."

        "des":"A toy or plaything is an object that is used primarily to provide entertainment. Simple examples include toy blocks, board games, and dolls. Toys are often designed for use by children, although many are designed specifically for adults and pets. Toys can provide utilitarian benefits, including physical exercise, cultural awareness, or academic education. Additionally, utilitarian objects, especially those which are no longer needed for their original purpose, can be used as toys. Examples include children building a fort with empty cereal boxes and tissue paper spools, or a toddler playing with a broken TV remote control. The term toy can also be used to refer to utilitarian objects purchased for enjoyment rather than need, or for expensive necessities for which a large fraction of the cost represents its ability to provide enjoyment to the owner, such as luxury cars, high-end motorcycles, gaming computers, and flagship smartphones. Playing with toys can be an enjoyable way of training young children for life experiences. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment and smart toys. Some toys are produced primarily as collectors' items and are intended for display only."

        "des":"A stuffed toy is a toy doll with an outer fabric sewn from a textile and stuffed with flexible material. They are known by many names, such as plush toys, plushies, stuffed animals, and stuffies; in Britain and Australia, they may also be called soft toys or cuddly toys. The stuffed toy originated from the Steiff company of Germany in the late 19th century and gained popularity following the creation of the teddy bear in the United States in 1903, at the same time the German toy inventor Richard Steiff designed a similar bear. In 1903, Peter Rabbit was the first fictional character to be made into a patented stuffed toy. In 1921, Christopher Robin's stuffed toy, given to him by his father A. A. Milne, would inspire the creation of Winnie-the-Pooh. In the 1970s, London-based Hamleys, the world's oldest toy store, bought the rights to Paddington Bear stuffed toys. In the 1990s, Ty Warner created Beanie Babies, a series of animals stuffed with plastic pellets that were popular as collector's items.   Stuffed toys are made in many different forms but most resemble real animals (sometimes with exaggerated proportions or features) legendary creatures cartoon characters or inanimate objects. They can be commercially or home-produced from numerous materials most commonly pile textiles like plush for the outer material and synthetic fiber for the stuffing. Often these toys are designed for children but stuffed toys are popular for a range of ages and uses and have been marked by fads in popular culture that sometimes affected collectors and the value of the toys."

We have collected some amazing examples of toy illustrations from our global community of designers. Get inspired and start planning the perfect toy illustration today. Children's illustrated books became fashionable during the Victorian period with an emphasis on the artistic value of the work at a period when the middle and upper classes had funds to spend on books for their offspring. Brightly coloured and well-designed toy books in particular became extremely popular. When the English publishing house Routledge and Warne contracted with printer Edmund Evans in 1865 to provide toy books for a growing marke the toy books he printed revolutionized the field of children's books. Large print runs often exceeding 10000 for first printings were necessary. Routledge asserted that each title required sales of 50000 to be profitable."

        "des":"Simply put, kids of all ages love playing with toy trucks because they are fun. In addition, these toys allow children to learn more about themselves and how they perceive the world around them through imaginative and constructive play. Just like how kids imitate and copy the actions of adults, they will learn how to associate different toys to their real-world counterparts and understand how they really work and what they are used for. If you are choosing new toys, pick options that have developmental value. Let’s take a closer look at four benefits surrounding playing toy trucks. In order to push a toy truck back and forth, a child has to use his or her fingers and hands. Developing and practicing hand eye coordination and fine motor skills at an early age should be a priority. These skills enable kids to perform precise movements with their fingers and hands such as playing the piano or using a pair of scissors to cut paper into different shapes. Children should be given the opportunity to hone these skills before they reach adolescence and adulthood."

While there is a long history of toys that look like robots, only recently has the cost of computation dropped sufficiently to allow the sale of truly functional robotic toys. This entry focuses on three examples of this new genre of toy that should be of interest from the ethics perspective: Lego MindStorms robot construction sets and Furby interactive robotic pet by Tiger Toys, and Sony Aibo robot dog. By contrast Furby was a plush but inexpensive, stand-alone, interactive toy. Multiple sensors (light, touch, sound, infra-red) drove a single motor, which, via a series of ingenious cams, controlled several motions of the ears, eyes, eyelids, mouth, and rear body (Pesce 2000). Enormously popular in its first season, with long lines at toy stores and price premiums featured on TV news, more than 12 million Furbys were sold in one year. Yet just as quickly the fad passed and in the early twenty-first century Furbys are no longer produced."

Apart from a few exceptions, they would be correct. How would they know this answer based on a single photograph? From the color to the textures to the use of each toy or object, it is quite obvious that most girl toys have certain characteristics. They all promote femininity, beauty, and certain gender roles. These gender roles include cooking, cleaning, other household chores, and taking care of babies, all of which can be seen in the three examples below. One of the most popular toy companies for girls all over the world is Barbie. Barbie has offered young girls dolls, dollhouses, and the accessories that go with them since 1959. Barbie has been very influential to young girls, affecting how they dress, and even how they act. Barbie has allowed girls to be creative and imaginative, deciding how to dress them, designing their homes, and choosing their adventures."
